## 🙌 Who am I

Full Stack Developer & DevOps Specialist. 
<br>
<br>
I'm a 22-year-old self-taught full stack developer and DevOps specialist who strives to create easy-to-use, accessible, and quality work.

 - I was in 2023 awarded the Danish ML-Prize, for my outstanding work in the tech field as an apprentice.

 - I'm currently employed as a DevOps Systems Engineer at a mother company [(Team.blue)](Team.blue), with ownership of +40 companies around Europe.

 - Everything on my Full Stack Development journey is done in my spare time, which is where I have learned basically everything I know.
